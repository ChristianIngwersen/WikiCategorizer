# WikiCategorizer

## Time plan
The weeks refer to the semester weeks. 

- **Before official project start**
  - Before the project begins our plan is to download and investigate all of the data, so we are comfortable with the data before we have to work with it. In addition, we'll familiarize us with the library [text2vec](<https://github.com/crownpku/text2vec>) and start generating text vectors for the wiki pages. 
  
- **Week 10**
  - Read and understand the paper [*The k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm Using MapReduce Paradigm*](<http://ijssst.info/Vol-15/No-3/data/3857a513.pdf>)
  - Start implementing the KNN algorithm using MapReduce as described in the paper.
  
- **Week 11**
  - Improve the efficiency of the first basic implementation.
  - Finish and test the implementation.
  
- **Week 12**
  - Make a command-line tool utilizing the algorithm.
  - Document results and start writing the report.
  
- **Week 13**
  - Finalize project presentation and report.
