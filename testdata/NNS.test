nearest neighbor search 
A way to solve the task of finding the $K$ most similar points in some feature space is using K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN). It calculates the $K$ neighbors that are the closest or most similar given some similarity metric. A typical choice for such a similarity metric is the \emph{Euclidian}-distance, which is the traditional metric as it is equivalent of using a ruler to measure the distance between two points. An alternative metric often used for high dimensional data is the \emph{Cosine}-distance, which doesn't care for the magnitude of the vectors, as it only looks at the angle between them. In this project, we will due to the structure of our data use the  \emph{Cosine}-distance as our similarity metric.
