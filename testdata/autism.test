characteristics

autism highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder first appears infancy childhood generally follows steady course without remission people autism may severely impaired respects normal even superior others overt symptoms gradually begin age six months become established age two three years tend continue adulthood although often muted form distinguished single symptom characteristic triad symptoms impairments social interaction impairments communication restricted interests repetitive behavior aspects atypical eating also common essential diagnosis autisms individual symptoms occur general population appear associate highly without sharp line separating pathologically severe common traits

social development
social deficits distinguish autism related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification developmental disorders people autism social impairments often lack intuition others many people take granted noted autistic temple grandin described inability understand social communication neurotypicals people normal neural development leaving feeling like anthropologist mars

unusual social development becomes apparent early childhood autistic infants show less attention social stimuli smile look others less often respond less name autistic toddlers differ strikingly social norms example less eye contact turntaking ability use simple movements express themselves pointing things three fiveyearold children autism less likely exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate respond emotions communicate nonverbally take turns others however form attachments primary caregivers children autism display moderately less attachment security neurotypical children although difference disappears children higher mental development less severe asd older children adults asd perform worse tests face emotion recognition although may partly due lower ability define persons emotions

children highfunctioning autism suffer intense frequent loneliness compared nonautistic peers despite common belief children autism prefer alone making maintaining friendships often proves difficult autism them quality friendships number friends predicts lonely feel functional friendships resulting invitations parties may affect quality life deeply

there many anecdotal reports systematic studies aggression violence individuals asd limited data suggest that children intellectual disability autism associated aggression destruction property tantrums

communication
about third half individuals autism develop enough natural speech meet daily communication needs differences communication may present first year life may include delayed onset babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness vocal patterns synchronized caregiver second third years children autism less frequent less diverse babbling consonants words word combinations gestures less often integrated words children autism less likely make requests share experiences likely simply repeat others words echolalia reverse pronouns joint attention seems necessary functional speech deficits joint attention seem distinguish infants asd example may look pointing hand instead pointedat object consistently fail point objects order comment share experience children autism may difficulty imaginative play developing symbols language

in pair studies highfunctioning children autism aged  performed equally well as adults better than individually matched controls basic language tasks involving vocabulary spelling autistic groups performed worse controls complex language tasks figurative language comprehension inference people often sized initially basic language skills studies suggest people speaking autistic individuals likely overestimate audience comprehends

repetitive behavior

autistic individuals display many forms repetitive restricted behavior repetitive behavior scalerevised rbsr categorizes follows

no single repetitive selfinjurious behavior seems specific autism autism appears elevated pattern occurrence severity behaviors

other symptoms
autistic individuals may symptoms independent diagnosis affect individual family

mechanism
autisms symptoms result maturationrelated changes various systems brain autism occurs well understood mechanism divided two areas pathophysiology brain structures processes associated autism neuropsychological linkages brain structures behaviors behaviors appear multiple pathophysiologies

pathophysiology

unlike many brain disorders parkinsons autism clear unifying mechanism either molecular cellular systems level known whether autism disorders caused mutations converging common molecular pathways like intellectual disability large set disorders diverse mechanisms autism appears result developmental factors affect many functional brain systems disturb timing brain development final product neuroanatomical studies associations teratogens strongly suggest autisms mechanism includes alteration brain development soon conception anomaly appears start cascade pathological events brain significantly influenced environmental factors birth brains children autism tend grow faster usual followed normal relatively slower growth childhood known whether early overgrowth occurs children autism seems prominent brain areas underlying development higher cognitive specialization hypotheses cellular molecular bases pathological early overgrowth include following

the immune system thought play important role autism children autism found researchers inflammation peripheral central immune systems indicated increased levels proinflammatory cytokines significant activation microglia biomarkers abnormal immune function also associated increased impairments behaviors characteristic core features autism deficits social interactions communication interactions immune system nervous system begin early embryonic stage life successful neurodevelopment depends balanced immune response thought activation pregnant mothers immune system environmental toxicants infection contribute causing autism causing disruption brain development supported recent studies found infection pregnancy associated increased risk autism

functional connectivity studies found hypo hyperconnectivity brains people autism hypoconnectivity seems dominate especially interhemispheric corticocortical functional connectivity

neuropsychology
two major categories cognitive theories proposed links autistic brains behavior

the first category focuses deficits social cognition simon baroncohens empathizingsystemizing theory postulates autistic individuals systemizethat is develop internal rules operation handle events inside brainbut less effective empathizing handling events generated agents extension extreme male brain theory hypothesizes autism extreme case male brain defined psychometrically individuals systemizing better empathizing theories somewhat related baroncohens earlier theory mind approach hypothesizes autistic behavior arises inability ascribe mental states oneself others theory mind hypothesis supported atypical responses children autism sallyanne test reasoning others motivations mirror neuron system theory autism described pathophysiology maps well hypothesis however studies found evidence impairment autistic individuals ability understand peoples basic intentions goals instead data suggests impairments found understanding complex social emotions considering others viewpoints

the second category focuses nonsocial general processing executive functions working memory planning inhibition review kenworthy states the claim executive dysfunction causal factor autism controversial however it clear executive dysfunction plays role social cognitive deficits observed individuals autism tests core executive processes eye movement tasks indicate improvement late childhood adolescence performance never reaches typical adult levels strength theory predicting stereotyped behavior narrow interests two weaknesses executive function hard measure executive function deficits found young children autism

weak central coherence theory hypothesizes limited ability see big picture underlies central disturbance autism one strength theory predicting special talents peaks performance autistic people related theoryenhanced perceptual functioningfocuses superiority locally oriented perceptual operations autistic individuals theories map well underconnectivity theory autism

neither category satisfactory own social cognition theories poorly address autisms rigid repetitive behaviors nonsocial theories difficulty explaining social impairment communication difficulties combined theory based multiple deficits may prove useful

diagnosis
diagnosis based behavior cause mechanism dsm autism characterized persistent deficits social communication interaction across multiple contexts well restricted repetitive patterns behavior interests activities deficits present early childhood typically age three lead clinically significant functional impairment sample symptoms include lack social emotional reciprocity stereotyped repetitive use language idiosyncratic language persistent preoccupation unusual objects disturbance must better accounted rett syndrome intellectual disability global developmental delay icd uses essentially definition

several diagnostic instruments available two commonly used autism research autism diagnostic interviewrevised adir semistructured parent interview autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation interaction child childhood autism rating scale cars used widely clinical environments assess severity autism based observation children diagnostic interview social communication disorders disco may also used

a pediatrician commonly performs preliminary investigation taking developmental history physically examining child warranted diagnosis evaluations conducted help asd specialists observing assessing cognitive communication family factors using standardized tools taking account associated medical conditions pediatric neuropsychologist often asked assess behavior cognitive skills aid diagnosis help recommend educational interventions differential diagnosis asd stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment specific language impairment landaukleffner syndrome presence autism make harder diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders depression

clinical genetics evaluations often done asd diagnosed particularly symptoms already suggest genetic cause although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists link estimated  cases genetic causes consensus guidelines us uk limited highresolution chromosome fragile x testing genotypefirst model diagnosis proposed would routinely assess genomes copy number variations new genetic tests developed several ethical legal social issues emerge commercial availability tests may precede adequate understanding use test results given complexity autisms genetics metabolic neuroimaging tests sometimes helpful routine

asd sometimes diagnosed age  months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable first three years life example oneyearold meets diagnostic criteria asd less likely threeyearold continue years later uk national autism plan children recommends  weeks first concern completed diagnosis assessment though cases handled quickly practice although symptoms autism asd begin early childhood sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses help friends family understand themselves help employers make adjustments locations claim disability living allowances benefits

underdiagnosis overdiagnosis problems marginal cases much recent increase number reported asd cases likely due changes diagnostic practices increasing popularity drug treatment options expansion benefits given providers incentives diagnose asd resulting overdiagnosis children uncertain symptoms conversely cost screening diagnosis challenge obtaining payment inhibit delay diagnosis particularly hard diagnose autism among visually impaired partly diagnostic criteria depend vision partly autistic symptoms overlap common blindness syndromes blindisms

some studies reported diagnoses autism children due loss language social skills opposed failure make progress typically   months age validity distinction remains controversial possible regressive autism specific subtype continuum behaviors autism without regression

research causes hampered inability identify biologically meaningful subgroups within autistic population traditional boundaries disciplines psychiatry psychology neurology pediatrics newer technologies fmri diffusion tensor imaging help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits viewed brain scans help neurogenetic studies autism one example lowered activity fusiform face area brain associated impaired perception people versus objects proposed classify autism using genetics well behavior

screening
about half parents children asd notice childs unusual behaviors age  months fourfifths notice age  months according article failure meet following milestones is absolute indication proceed evaluations delay referral testing may delay early diagnosis treatment affect longterm outcome

the united states preventive services task force  found unclear screening beneficial harmful among children concerns japanese practice screen children asd   months using autismspecific formal screening tests contrast uk children whose families doctors recognize possible signs autism screened known approach effective screening tools include modified checklist autism toddlers mchat early screening autistic traits questionnaire first year inventory initial data mchat predecessor checklist autism toddlers chat children aged  months suggests best used clinical setting low sensitivity many falsenegatives good specificity few falsepositives may accurate precede tests broadband screener distinguish asd developmental disorders screening tools designed one cultures norms behaviors like eye contact may inappropriate different culture although genetic screening autism generally still impractical considered cases children neurological symptoms dysmorphic features

prevention
infection rubella pregnancy causes fewer  cases autism vaccination rubella prevent many cases

management
the main goals treating children autism lessen associated deficits family distress increase quality life functional independence general higher iqs correlated greater responsiveness treatment improved treatment outcomes single treatment best treatment typically tailored childs needs families educational system main resources treatment studies interventions methodological problems prevent definitive conclusions efficacy however development evidencebased interventions advanced recent years although many psychosocial interventions positive evidence suggesting form treatment preferable treatment methodological quality systematic reviews studies generally poor clinical results mostly tentative little evidence relative effectiveness treatment options intensive sustained special education programs behavior therapy early life help children acquire selfcare social job skills often improve functioning decrease symptom severity maladaptive behaviors claims intervention around age three years crucial substantiated available approaches include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech language therapy social skills therapy occupational therapy among approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively focalize treatment specific area deficit evidence early intensive behavioral intervention eibi early intervention model based aba  Â hours week multiple years effective treatment children asd two theoretical frameworks outlined early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis aba developmental social pragmatic models dsp one interventional strategy utilizes parent training model teaches parents implement various aba dsp techniques allowing parents disseminate interventions themselves various dsp programs developed explicitly deliver intervention systems athome parent implementation despite recent development parent training models interventions demonstrated effectiveness numerous studies evaluated probable efficacious mode treatment

education
educational interventions effective varying degrees children intensive aba treatment demonstrated effectiveness enhancing global functioning preschool children wellestablished improving intellectual performance young children similarly teacherimplemented intervention utilizes aba combined developmental social pragmatic approach found wellestablished treatment improving socialcommunication skills young children although less evidence treatment global symptoms neuropsychological reports often poorly communicated educators resulting gap report recommends education provided known whether treatment programs children lead significant improvements children grow up limited research effectiveness adult residential programs shows mixed results appropriateness including children varying severity autism spectrum disorders general education population subject current debate among educators researchers

medication
many medications used treat asd symptoms interfere integrating child home school behavioral treatment fails half us children diagnosed asd prescribed psychoactive drugs anticonvulsants common drug classes antidepressants stimulants antipsychotics antipsychotics risperidone aripiprazole found useful treating irritability repetitive behavior sleeplessness often occurs autism however side effects must weighed potential benefits people autism may respond atypically scant reliable research effectiveness safety drug treatments adolescents adults asd known medication relieves autisms core symptoms social communication impairments experiments mice reversed reduced symptoms related autism replacing modulating gene function suggesting possibility targeting therapies specific rare mutations known cause autism

alternative medicine
although many alternative therapies interventions available supported scientific studies treatment approaches little empirical support qualityoflife contexts many programs focus success measures lack predictive validity realworld relevance scientific evidence appears matter less service providers program marketing training availability parent requests alternative treatments may place child risk  study found compared peers autistic boys significantly thinner bones caseinfree diets  botched chelation therapy killed fiveyearold child autism early research looking hyperbaric treatments children autism

although popularly used alternative treatment people autism good evidence glutenfree diet benefit subset people gluten sensitivity limited evidence suggests gluten free diet may improve autistic behaviors

cost
treatment expensive indirect costs so someone born  us study estimated average lifetime cost  net present value dollars inflationadjusted  estimate  medical care  extra education care  lost economic productivity publicly supported programs often inadequate inappropriate given child unreimbursed outofpocket medical therapy expenses associated likelihood family financial problems one  us study found  average loss annual income families children asd related study found asd associated higher probability child care problems greatly affect parental employment us states increasingly require private health insurance cover autism services shifting costs publicly funded education programs privately funded health insurance childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training placement sexuality social skills estate planning

society culture

the emergence autism rights movement served attempt encourage people tolerant autism movement people hope cause others think autism difference instead disease proponents movement wish seek acceptance cures also many worldwide events promoting autism awareness world autism awareness day light blue autism sunday autistic pride day autreat others also many organizations dedicated increasing awareness autism effects autism someones life organizations include autism speaks autism national committee autism society america many others socialscience scholars increased focused studying autism hopes learn autism culture transcultural comparisons research social movements media influence public perceives autism rain man film  oscars including best picture depicts character autism incredible talents abilities many autistics special abilities autistic individuals successful fields

prognosis
